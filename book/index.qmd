# Preface {.unnumbered}

Somewhere in a packaging plant, five machines are humming.

They fill, seal, label, count... \
Ten thousand times a day, six days a week, fifty weeks a year. Quietly... \
Nobody pays much attention. Until one stops. Then everyone pays *very* attention. 🚨

Here's the thing: they've been talking all along.

Every start, every stop, every hiccup, every suspiciously long unplanned pause — all of it logged. Timestamped. Waiting. **429,000 rows** of it, across five machines and two years.

This series is about finally listening.

We'll go from *"what on earth is this column?"* all the way to *"wait, can we actually predict when this thing is about to break down?"* — with R code, real numbers, and the occasional raised eyebrow at what the data reveals.

No prior knowledge of data science required. Some tolerance for R code recommended. A vague familiarity with the concept of a machine that occasionally misbehaves: mandatory.

*A note on the data:* I'd have loved to show you logs from a real plant I've worked with. Instead, here's a dataset from Kaggle that is, frankly, a very decent replacement : [Packaging Industry Anomaly Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/orvile/packaging-industry-anomaly-detection-dataset). Real enough to be interesting. Anonymised enough that nobody gets fired.

**Stack** : R, tidyverse, Quarto

> *Six episodes. Five machines. One question: what were they trying to tell us?*
