# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book documents an end-to-end data analysis of a real packaging production dataset,
from raw log exploration to anomaly detection and predictive modelling.

**Dataset** : [Packaging Industry Anomaly Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/orvile/packaging-industry-anomaly-detection-dataset) — Kaggle
**Stack** : R, tidyverse, Quarto
**Code** : [github.com/ArnaudCoqueblin/when-machines-talk](https://github.com/ArnaudCoqueblin/when-machines-talk)

---

Each chapter corresponds to a LinkedIn post in the series *"When Machines Talk"*.
The analysis progresses from data understanding to predictive modelling — each step building on the previous one.

> *"429,000 rows of production logs. Five machines. Two years. What do they actually tell us?"*
