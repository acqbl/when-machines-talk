## Tone & Writing Style

When writing narrative content (preface, chapter introductions, LinkedIn posts):
- **Dry British humour** — understated, slightly self-deprecating, deadpan
- Short punchy sentences. No purple prose.
- Accessible to non-technical readers without dumbing down
- Concrete over abstract — always ground concepts in the factory/machine reality
