Instead of using a real dataset, I chose this one from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/orvile/packaging-industry-anomaly-detection-dataset

# Raw Data

Each row represents a production interval, with the following schema:

interval_start: start of the production interval \
equipment_ID: equipment identifier \
alarm: alarm code of the active stop reason, if it occurred \
type: idle, production, downtime, performance_loss or scheduled_downtime \
start: start of the production interval \
end: end of the production interval \
elapsed: duration of the production interval \
pi: input packages \
po: output packages \
speed: speed (packages per hour)

There are 133 different types of alerts, and 429394 rows.
